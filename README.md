This project integrates Python, HTML, CSS, and JS. Although I added a venv, i had some issues with GitHub it ignoring the files correctly (that wy to see the proj you must create a venv than install Flask). The project took ~ 2.5 hours, and i thoroughly enjoyed the process. Designing the interface is my favourite part of web dev. I enjoy making large-scale projects, and this was no exception
